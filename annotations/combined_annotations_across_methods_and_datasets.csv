I've gotten bids from multiple companies. However, I'm unsure which one I will eventually have to go with. There are a lot of very complicated factors that go into each bid. Some include some features of the roof. Some don't, some are an additional expense that could be unknown until the roof is nearly completed. Each company also has different warranties, different requirements for the warranties. It's just a complicated mess. It's making me feel very unsure about the future, my future, my house's future and the reasons I bought the house to begin with. I'm a little bit frightened too because it reminds me of the house I grew up in which also had a leaky roof in the kitchen. Unfortunately, given the age of the roof, I'm stuck with a lot of unanswered questions for each bid and I just don't really know who to who to go with.

Uh, my mother married him two years after my father passed away. And, uh, we've had a cordial relationship, um, mostly respect and I could really see the reason why my mother loved him. Um, I never was as close to him as I was my father. But I mean, I felt like that we were friends anyway. Uh, however, we did kind of go sour when my mother passed away. Uh, I'm not gonna even go into all that. It's a long story. But let's just say I had some, um, some bitterness about things that happened when she passed and she passed away in October of last year. Well, after she passed away, he became sick with COVID and then he had to have surgery and he was in the hospital for about a month and a half total. And I really tried to set aside my feelings and help him out because he really didn't have anybody else in the world. All his other family is gone. And, um, anyway, I felt like I was just gonna go ahead and keep trying to take care of him as much as possible. However, three months after my mother passed away, he called me one day to tell me he just married this woman and it's a woman who is 70 years old and he's 85. So, um, of course, I know exactly why she wanted to marry him more than likely. It's because she wants to get the house and this is a house that my father paid for. But, you know, that's all here. That's neither here or there. But my whole thing is I felt like it was such a disrespect, not only to the fact that my mother just passed away three months before, but he didn't introduce this woman to me or any of my other family and it just felt very disrespectful and like he didn't really care about us at all. So, um, the thing is he is my son's grandfather and he is contacting me like, well, why don't you ever come see me anymore? And I did tell him that I did not, I mean, I told him straightforward exactly my feelings about everything. But I also have this deep feeling that maybe I should forgive him and go see him. That that's what my mother would want me to do. So that's a question that I'm grappling with

Supporter: I understand, it sucks. But part of life is understanding that sometimes you will be in situations where you’re unappreciated and that your efforts were legitimately just for nothing. It doesn’t mean it wasn’t important to experience and learn and apply your skills. Life is also about letting go and knowing you can do better and be confident in your own skills.

Of course, this has created a lot of stress due to how expensive it is to live these days and the uncertainty of what's going forward because in my job search, I found it rather hard to get interviews, let alone offers for positions. This affects every part of my life. I'm saving as much money as I can before it happens. And every bit I meet every bit I make doesn't seem to be enough. So I'm just looking for every option to get myself out of this hole before the hole is completely dug.

I tried seeing somebody else and thankfully to me, thankfully they canceled because it felt like I was cheating on my ex partner and I don't really know what to do. My relationship with my ex wasn't the best but not. Well, sometimes it was, we were together for 9.5 years and I don't know what to do to try to be with her again or to see somebody else, which will, which causes me a lot of anxiety. Uh I don't like meeting other people. So now I'm just stuck and there's no one to really talk to it about because everyone will just say not to go back with my ex. She moved out now I'm all alone and it is very lonely, but I felt lonely with her for years because something changed about her. But since she broke up and when we hang out once a week, she seems like how she used to be. She seems great. Maybe we just shouldn't live together. It's a lot of things to think about and I don't know what the right answer is. Either way. I'm very unhappy. I don't know what to do about it.

Supporter: It's always hard when you have a relationship it starts out great and then sort of gets lost I guess it's the right word. It's great to be able to go out with your ex once in a while and experience what you once had, but you'll never be able to move on until you let go of what you had before. If she didn't really want to break it off she would not have moved out you sound like a good person and should consider moving on.",,hit:3931_conv:7863,2,3.0,5.0,llm,"Seeker: I stole alcohol from my dad and got caught_comma_ I'm ashamed.

The thing is, not everyone is built for that. Especially, I have found, it can sort of weird people out when the Rock, the Stable One, the One Person In This Messed Up World Who Has Their Stuff Together needs help. I mean, here's the person they go to and they rely on when they need support... and that person needs support. Suddenly you're not Superman anymore and it can be a bit disconcerting. Perhaps try introducing A problem at a time, slowly, and seeing if they can get used to you also being a normal human with issues. Good luck!!",

And now years later I still am dealing with that issue. I'm still on methadone, but I'm using fentaNYL on top of it. So it's, um, extremely hard issue to deal with. I've tried several times to break free from this. I've been in several facilities.

Supporter: Hi,
I would suggest working with a dietitian in order to first determine what nutrients that your body might be missing. Then you can figure out a plan of action by taking a combination of vitamins and foods that also provide the vitamins and other nutrients that your body is probably low in. If you maintain the Mediterranean diet, your drug addiction issues might disappear. I would also recommend using chocolate products to help you step down from using drugs. I've heard it shares the same origin as cocaine and thus would be considered a legal ""non-drug, drug"".

I found myself in the midst of a complex and delicate situation that involves an ethical dilemma with far reaching consequences for my professional and personal life. In my role as a wide marketing coordinator, I am responsible for ensuring fair and legal practices in the market place. I work closely with vendors, suppliers and various stakeholders to maintain a level playing field and uphold industry standards. Recently, I have discovered evidence that one of our key suppliers has been engaging in unethical practices such as exploiting labor using child workers and disregarding environmental regulations in their manufacturing processes. The evidence I have uncovered implicates the supplier's top management and if exposed, it could lead to severe legal consequences, not only for the company but also for my own organization. On the other hand, turning a blind eye to these unethical practices would betray the very principles of responsibilities and hold D A as a coordinator. In conclusion, navigating this challenge decision as a wide marketing coordinator requires careful consideration of multiple factors, ethical principles and potential outcomes.

Supporter: Wow. You've got a weighty decision to make. Actually, have you let your company's CEO know? Considering the gravity of your discovery, it might be best if you scheduled a quick meeting with him/her and let the CEO make the decision. That's what they're paid to do, after all -- make decisions. Also, you'd be off the hook. Anyway, just a suggestion.

Supporter: I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey. Work with your psychiatrist and maybe even work with a therapist if you can. Do all you can do to find the proper treatment, and YOU WILL BE OKAY. You are not",

There's a possibility though that if anything happens to the owner of that house, I may be able to take over the mortgage, but the amount that the mortgage costs is extremely expensive, I could probably afford it, but I'm not positive. So I'm not sure if it would be better for me to stay where I am and try and make repairs to this house, even though I could also possibly lose this house if anything happens to the other person or if I should go ahead and make repairs to the other house and possibly lose everything.

Supporter: After hearing about your housing options it actually seems like you're in a better place, either way, than not. Both options, whether to stay in your current situation or to move have some road bumps, but nothing too extravagant. Yes, both you may have to put money up front, but the outcome of either sound like they would be financially worthy in the end. However if you are asking my opinion, I would say the second option of moving would benefit both you and the person you could potentially help out.

As much as we feel that way, our job as parents is to teach them how to be able to stand on their own two feet, because we are not always going to be there to protect them from everything life throws at them. I know you are afraid for your son and grandson. I know that in your son's situation it's hard to see right from wrong.
