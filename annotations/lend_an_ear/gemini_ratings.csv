Supporter: Don't be discouraged. Maybe the universe has plans to offer up something better for you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate the thought, but it's hard to see the silver lining right now. I put in so much effort, and it feels like it just went unnoticed. It's frustrating to think that all my hard work might not be enough.
Supporter: It always hurts when things like this happen but I promise you it will get better. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I know things might improve eventually, but right now it just feels like a huge setback. It's tough to stay motivated when it seems like my efforts aren't being valued. I just wish I knew what more I could do to be seen and appreciated for my work.
Supporter: Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get where you're coming from, but it feels like I've already been doing so much. It's just disheartening to think that I need to do even more to be recognized. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if it's worth it to keep pushing myself like this.
Supporter: You have to push to do better because then you'll have motivation when another opportunity arises. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I understand the idea of staying motivated for future opportunities, but it's hard to keep pushing when it feels like my efforts aren't being acknowledged now. I just wish there was a way to know that what I'm doing is actually making a difference. It's tough to keep giving my all when I'm not sure if it even matters.
Supporter: I think everyone feels that way about their job. That's why we set high standards for ourselves. Because even if others don't notice our hard work we notice it ourselves. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get that, and I do try to hold myself to high standards. But sometimes it feels like I'm just running in circles without any real progress. I just wish there was more acknowledgment from those who have the power to make a difference in my career.
Supporter: Maybe you should find a different work environment. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I’ve thought about that, but it’s not an easy decision to make. I’ve invested a lot in this company, and I really believed in the work we were doing. It’s just hard to know if leaving is the right move or if I should keep trying to make it work here.

Supporter: I feel that way everyday myself. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's tough, isn't it? Sometimes it feels like we're just on autopilot, and it's hard to find a way back to feeling present. Do you ever find yourself wondering how to break out of that cycle?
Supporter: Being on autopilot 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, it's like I'm stuck in this loop and can't find the exit. I keep thinking there must be a way to reconnect with what really matters, but it's hard to see the path forward when everything feels so overwhelming. Do you ever feel like you're just missing out on the important moments?
Supporter: Yes all the time! 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to find a balance between work and personal life without sacrificing one for the other. Do you have any strategies that help you stay connected to what truly matters?
Supporter: I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That sounds like a good approach. I try to remind myself too, but sometimes it feels like the reminders get lost in the chaos. How do you keep those priorities front and center when things get hectic?
Supporter: I just keep tunnel vision and stay focused 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I admire your ability to stay focused like that. I find it challenging to maintain that kind of tunnel vision when everything feels like it's pulling me in different directions. Do you ever struggle with feeling like you're missing out on other aspects of life while staying so focused?
Supporter: Yes I do because I also have a tendency to focus rather hard on things that hold no weight 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I can relate to that. Sometimes I get so caught up in work that I lose sight of what truly matters, and it feels like I'm missing out on the little joys. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who struggles with this balance.
Supporter: You definitely aren't the only one. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others are navigating similar challenges. I guess it's about finding ways to remind ourselves of what truly matters, even when it's tough.
Supporter: Everyone's life experience is subjective. Just follow what matters to you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's true, and I appreciate the reminder. It's just hard sometimes to figure out what truly matters when everything feels so urgent. I guess it's a journey of figuring it out as we go along.
Supporter: That's the fun part 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I suppose it can be, though it doesn't always feel that way in the moment. Maybe it's about finding those small moments of joy and clarity amidst the chaos. It's reassuring to think that even in the struggle, there's room for growth and discovery.

Seeker: Yeah, it really is. Even though I kind of expected it, actually getting the news was like a punch to the gut. I'm just trying to wrap my head around what to do next and how to start over at this point in my life.
Supporter: Starting over can be a tough challenge. Keep in mind that this period will pass and sometimes starting over can be a positive experience
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate you saying that. It's just hard to see the positive side right now when everything feels so uncertain. I guess I'm just worried about how long it might take to find something new and if anyone will even consider hiring someone my age.
Supporter: I understand. Maybe just focus on taking care of the basics right now
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, you're right. I think I need to take it one step at a time and not get too ahead of myself. It's just hard not to let my mind race with all the ""what ifs.""
Supporter: Are there some positive things you can do outside of the job hunt that can help take your mind off it?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I suppose I could try to focus on some hobbies or things I've always wanted to do but never had the time for. Maybe getting back into painting or taking some long walks could help clear my head. It's just a bit tough to shift my mindset from work to personal time right now.
Supporter: I understand. clearing your head is important though and can help you focus better on the job hunt.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, I think you're right. Maybe if I can find a way to enjoy some downtime, it'll help me feel more grounded and ready to tackle the job search. It's just a matter of giving myself permission to take that break without feeling guilty.

Supporter: What is one of the main things that are overwhelming and how can I help?

Supporter: 
Seeker: I think the idea of updating my resume and figuring out how to present myself after so many years is really daunting. It's been ages since I've had to do this, and I'm not sure where to even start. Just having someone to bounce ideas off or maybe look over my resume when I get to it would be a huge help.

Supporter: something else was going on .  Nepotism?

Supporter: That’s really difficult. I hope you know you’re not alone in this and there are solutions to this problem, even if they aren’t clear right now. Stress is normal in new positions at work and so is the ability to sus out a new work-life balance during it.

Supporter: I lost my job similarly recently, so I get it. What was your position / role?

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I was an HR manager at a health company. It's strange because I spent so many years there, and now it feels like all that effort just vanished. It's hard not to worry about what comes next, especially at my age.
Supporter: I see. that really is unfortunate. You said you anticipated it coming - have you begun applying to other places? Maybe you could obtain a similar role elsewhere

Seeker: Not yet. The thought of updating my resume and starting the job hunt again feels overwhelming. Plus, I'm worried about whether companies will even consider someone my age.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I guess it's because I set such high expectations for myself in both areas. At work, I want to prove that I deserve the promotion, and at home, I want to be the best parent and partner I can be. When I fall short in either, it feels like I'm letting everyone down, including myself.
