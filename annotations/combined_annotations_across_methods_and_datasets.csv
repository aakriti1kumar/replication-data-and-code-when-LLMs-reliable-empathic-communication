Seeker: 
Supporter:

Supporter: I just keep tunnel vision and stay focused

Supporter: 
Seeker: I admire your ability to stay focused like that. I find it challenging to maintain that kind of tunnel vision when everything feels like it's pulling me in different directions. Do you ever struggle with feeling like you're missing out on other aspects of life while staying so focused?
Supporter: Yes I do because I also have a tendency to focus rather hard on things that hold no weight 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I can relate to that. Sometimes I get so caught up in work that I lose sight of what truly matters, and it feels like I'm missing out on the little joys. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who struggles with this balance.
Supporter: You definitely aren't the only one. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others are navigating similar challenges. I guess it's about finding ways to remind ourselves of what truly matters, even when it's tough.
Supporter: Everyone's life experience is subjective. Just follow what matters to you.

Supporter:

Supporter:

Supporter: What about the new job is making you feel like this? Do you think it is temporary and that it might improve with time?

Supporter:

Seeker: I used to love the creative problem-solving aspect, diving into code and finding elegant solutions. But lately, even that feels like a chore. It's like the joy has been overshadowed by the constant pressure and exhaustion.
Supporter: I feel for you. That has to be hard. Do you think there is anything at home or in your personal life that is also affecting this?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I think it's all connected. At home, I feel like I'm missing out on so much with my family, and that just adds to the guilt and stress. It's like I'm caught in a cycle where work affects home and home affects work, and I can't seem to find a balance.
Supporter: Have you talked to your boss or significant other about this?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I've tried to bring it up with my spouse, but it often turns into a conversation about logistics rather than how I'm really feeling. As for my boss, I worry about seeming incapable or ungrateful, especially after the promotion. It's tough to open up when I'm not even sure what I need.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Honestly, I'm not sure what to do next. Part of me wants to just keep my head down and do the bare minimum, but another part of me feels like I should keep pushing to prove myself. It's just hard to stay motivated when it feels like my efforts aren't being recognized.
Supporter: Well it's up to you to make that decision, whether to waste time and energy for a fruitless endeavor or just do the bare minimum.

Supporter: 
Seeker: I get that it's ultimately my decision, but it's tough to figure out the right path when I'm feeling so stuck. I just wish there was a way to know if my hard work will ever really pay off. It's frustrating to feel like I'm putting in all this effort and not seeing the results I hoped for.
Supporter: There's not really a way to know that so you're going to have  to just choose on what you feel is going to be a better use of your time.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, I guess that's true. It's just hard to make that choice when I'm feeling so disheartened. I really appreciate you listening, though—sometimes it just helps to talk it out.
Supporter: Maybe just do the bare minimum until you aren't disheartened anymore then make the decision after considering all of the factors involved.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I see what you're saying, and maybe taking a step back could help me clear my head. It's just tough to shake off this feeling of being undervalued. I really hope things start to make more sense soon.
Supporter: If you feel you're being undervalued then maybe you are. You might just need to accept that fact.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's hard to accept that, though, because I really believed in the work I was doing and thought it mattered. I just wish there was a way to know if it's worth sticking it out or if I should start looking for opportunities where I might be more appreciated. It's a lot to think about, and I just want to make the right choice for myself.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I think it's a mix of the pressure at work and the guilt of not being present for my family. The promotion was supposed to be a good thing, but it feels like it's taken over my life. I just can't seem to find a balance between my career and my personal life.

Supporter: Has something changed recently in your day to day life?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Honestly, it's been a gradual build-up. The promotion added more responsibilities, and with that came longer hours and more stress. I guess I didn't realize how much it would impact my daily routine until it was too late.
Supporter: Ah yes, I totally hear what you are saying.

Supporter:

Supporter: You got that promotion you wanted but now you feel overwhelmed, is that it?
Seeker: 
Supporter:

Supporter: 
Seeker: It was for the Product Marketing Manager position. I really thought I had a good shot because I've been putting in so much effort and coming up with ideas that have been well-received. It's just tough to see someone else get it when I know how much I've put into this.

Supporter: I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life. Whether it was for childhood epilepsy, ADHD, depression, and the last diagnosis cyclothymia. Was hospitalized twice before I got the cyclothymia diagnosis, and it was pretty bad at one point, and looking back.. I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.

Supporter: That can be helpful, and I'll always be here if you want to talk more
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I really appreciate that. It’s comforting to know I have someone to lean on while I sort through all of this. I might take you up on that offer to talk more as I figure things out.

Supporter: Yes I can understand how you feel. It's always shocking when you lose your job. Would you like to talk more about it?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's just a lot to process right now. I mean, I knew the signs were there, but actually getting that email was like a punch to the gut. I'm trying to wrap my head around what to do next, but it's hard not to feel overwhelmed.
Supporter: I can understand why you would feel that way, do I have a permission to give you some advice? Or do you just prefer to talk about it.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Honestly, I think I just need to talk about it for now. It's been such a whirlwind of emotions, and I'm not quite ready to think about next steps yet. Just having someone to listen really helps.
Supporter: Okay. Would you care to just discuss your emotions that you're trying to work through right now? Are you willing to give yourself the time you need to process your emotions?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's a mix of relief and fear, honestly. I'm relieved that the uncertainty is over, but the fear of what's next is pretty overwhelming. I guess I'm just trying to let myself feel everything without rushing into decisions.
Supporter: That's a very good idea, take a couple of days off or whatever you need to process these emotions. Are you willing to do this? I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this, and hearing that you've been through it too makes me feel a bit more understood. I think taking a few days to just breathe and process everything might be what I need. It's just hard to shake off the worry about what comes next, you know?
Supporter: ell until you come to the decision about what your next step should be, may I suggest putting it on the back burner? Will you give yourself a break or are you being too hard on yourself?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I think you're right; I probably am being too hard on myself. It's just tough to switch off that part of my brain that's always planning and worrying. Maybe giving myself permission to take a break is exactly what I need right now.
Supporter: it certainly does sound like something that you need to do? Maybe get away for a day or two? Talk to some former colleagues?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That might be a good idea. A change of scenery could help clear my mind, and catching up with some former colleagues might give me a fresh perspective. It's nice to think about doing something for myself for a change.
Supporter: I can tell from this conversation that you're very intelligent and perhaps you are too logical, getting away for a day or two might do you some good?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think you're right; stepping away for a bit could help me reset and maybe even spark some new ideas. It's just about giving myself permission to do it without feeling guilty.
Supporter: Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I guess it's just that nagging feeling of needing to be productive all the time. It's hard to shake off the guilt of not doing something ""useful,"" even when I know taking care of myself is important. But you're right, I need to remind myself that it's okay to take a step back.
Supporter: I'm glad you agree with me and if you don't take care of yourself, who will? Even if there's other people who depend on you, still have to take care of yourself so that you don't get burnt out,?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's a good point. I guess I've always been the one to take care of others, so it's a bit of a shift to focus on myself. But I know it's necessary, and I appreciate the reminder that it's okay to prioritize my own well-being.
Supporter: Yes sometimes prioritizing your own well-being has to come first. I agree, even if you feel shocked and disoriented right now, give yourself time to process what is happening you will feel better I'm sure.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I hope so. It's reassuring to hear that it's okay to take this time for myself. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's a process and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.
