Because without that, he's always at risk of falling and injuring himself severely. My dad is very stubborn. He doesn't want to be told what to do and he doesn't want to feel like he's dependent. So how to convince him to use a walker or the wheelchair is a situation that I'm currently dealing with, that's giving me a lot of frustration.

Supporter: You need to talk to your father from a place of understanding, and let him know that you understand how hard it is to give up the freedoms he's enjoyed his entire life. However, he also has a very loving family that is very worried about him, and doesn't want to see him fall and get hurt (or worse). Tell him that him using a walker isn't so much about loosing his independence, it's easing the worries of those who care about him.",1,2,2,2,2,3,1,7,5

I have about $9000 in credit card debt and I am not doing a good job with lowering it, but I instead seem to be adding to it. I have a problem with impulsive purchases and always feeling like the need to buy more, which is something that I'm really struggling with and I'm not sure how to address it. I think the biggest issue with that be that I need to really get to the root of what makes me spend and so that I can figure out how to stop because having this credit card debt is embarrassing and um a source of negative emotions.

Supporter: I understand you have no self control and will allow your finances to control you instead of controlling them. You should be embarrassed because it is not spending out of need but out of want. Cut up your cards and pay your bills.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,6,1

But I was told that if I kept my mouth shut and stayed until the sale, I would get an 80% a bonus from my salary. I lived with it for as long as I could. And then I found them starting to really employ, uh, refer to the employees as numbers in departments instead of as individuals. And that went a little too far with me. I knew that they were going to eliminate whole departments of good people and they wanted to blindside them. I couldn't allow that to happen. I decided to risk the 80% bonus and I started teaching people how to do their, uh, resume so that they can apply for another job. I also help people get other jobs in the end. I did stay until the sale. I did get my 80% bonus. They were very upset that I was telling the employees, but I was in such a position that it was a catch 22 for them. If they got rid of me, then everybody was gonna find out anyway. And if they kept me that maybe the, the place would keep running until the cell shortly after the sale, 90% of all the employees were terminated. I retired at 60 a half. So it cost me quite a few years of income. But in the end I'm satisfied with what I did.

Supporter: That's a really tough situation, and not a lot of people would have responded the same way you did. You did the right thing.

Um There's a request to uh build out a product uh that would be used internally in the system. Um The only issue is is that the system's being rewritten at the same time. Um So it's gonna look totally different in uh about uh 18 months. So the, uh the issue is, uh do we wait 18 months and then build out the actual product? Do we spend the next 18 months making that as good as possible or do we spend three or four months coming up with a minimum viable product that we're just gonna have to totally redo once we move into the new system? And if so, um what are the pros and cons of that? What do we build into that? Um How does that impact the final product once you move it into the new system? So it's a lot going on. It, it really just comes down to do, we want to spend a ton of time and money building something that we're only gonna be using for less than a year or, um, do we come up with some other solution that may not work as well? But we can get out quicker, uh, and then shift to building out a good, like the best product we can build once we move into that new system.

Supporter: I would be happy to give you advice with your work project. I would look into how much work it will take to rebuild the product in a couple of months once the new system is built out and the cost. Based on that information it might be best to not build out their product it is going to cost you more of your time and money to do so.

Actually, I was on the streets during the nineties. Um, you know, doing heroin daily committing crimes to get money, you know, prostitution, all that stuff in 2000, in 2001, I got on methadone and things cleared up. You know, I stayed on methadone. I got a job, I became somewhat normal person for like almost 10 years and then I had a relapse was starting to do opiates again on top of the methadone.

I've tried several times to break free from this. I've been in several facilities.

Supporter: Hi,
I would suggest working with a dietitian in order to first determine what nutrients that your body might be missing. Then you can figure out a plan of action by taking a combination of vitamins and foods that also provide the vitamins and other nutrients that your body is probably low in. If you maintain the Mediterranean diet, your drug addiction issues might disappear. I would also recommend using chocolate products to help you step down from using drugs. I've heard it shares the same origin as cocaine and thus would be considered a legal ""non-drug, drug"".

Good luck.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,7,3
57e7bb4e73e67300012b8e2a,"Seeker: The question I'm grappling with is whether I should include my stepfather in my life. And he's been my stepfather for 23 years. Uh, my mother married him two years after my father passed away. And, uh, we've had a cordial relationship, um, mostly respect and I could really see the reason why my mother loved him. Um, I never was as close to him as I was my father. But I mean, I felt like that we were friends anyway. Uh, however, we did kind of go sour when my mother passed away. Uh, I'm not gonna even go into all that. It's a long story. But let's just say I had some, um, some bitterness about things that happened when she passed and she passed away in October of last year. Well, after she passed away, he became sick with COVID and then he had to have surgery and he was in the hospital for about a month and a half total. And I really tried to set aside my feelings and help him out because he really didn't have anybody else in the world. All his other family is gone. And, um, anyway, I felt like I was just gonna go ahead and keep trying to take care of him as much as possible. However, three months after my mother passed away, he called me one day to tell me he just married this woman and it's a woman who is 70 years old and he's 85. So, um, of course, I know exactly why she wanted to marry him more than likely. It's because she wants to get the house and this is a house that my father paid for. But, you know, that's all here. That's neither here or there. But my whole thing is I felt like it was such a disrespect, not only to the fact that my mother just passed away three months before, but he didn't introduce this woman to me or any of my other family and it just felt very disrespectful and like he didn't really care about us at all. So, um, the thing is he is my son's grandfather and he is contacting me like, well, why don't you ever come see me anymore? And I did tell him that I did not, I mean, I told him straightforward exactly my feelings about everything. But I also have this deep feeling that maybe I should forgive him and go see him. That that's what my mother would want me to do. So that's a question that I'm grappling with

My relationship with my ex wasn't the best but not. Well, sometimes it was, we were together for 9.5 years and I don't know what to do to try to be with her again or to see somebody else, which will, which causes me a lot of anxiety. Uh I don't like meeting other people. So now I'm just stuck and there's no one to really talk to it about because everyone will just say not to go back with my ex. She moved out now I'm all alone and it is very lonely, but I felt lonely with her for years because something changed about her.

It's great to be able to go out with your ex once in a while and experience what you once had, but you'll never be able to move on until you let go of what you had before.

I found myself in the midst of a complex and delicate situation that involves an ethical dilemma with far reaching consequences for my professional and personal life. In my role as a wide marketing coordinator, I am responsible for ensuring fair and legal practices in the market place. I work closely with vendors, suppliers and various stakeholders to maintain a level playing field and uphold industry standards. Recently, I have discovered evidence that one of our key suppliers has been engaging in unethical practices such as exploiting labor using child workers and disregarding environmental regulations in their manufacturing processes. The evidence I have uncovered implicates the supplier's top management and if exposed, it could lead to severe legal consequences, not only for the company but also for my own organization. On the other hand, turning a blind eye to these unethical practices would betray the very principles of responsibilities and hold D A as a coordinator. In conclusion, navigating this challenge decision as a wide marketing coordinator requires careful consideration of multiple factors, ethical principles and potential outcomes.

Supporter: Wow. You've got a weighty decision to make. Actually, have you let your company's CEO know? Considering the gravity of your discovery, it might be best if you scheduled a quick meeting with him/her and let the CEO make the decision.

Um, I bought a house with my fiance a few months back and it's been a bit of an adjustment to, you know, allow for that mortgage payment to go through. That's significantly more than the rent that we previously paid. Um, and also just all of the upkeep and the many things that come up that you'll need to buy when you buy a house for the first time. So, um, and it's been tricky. I've, uh, certainly been trying my best to handle everything and to practice better saving techniques. Um, and, you know, spend less recklessly, but, um, it makes me feel stressed, it makes me feel like I don't have much control over my life. Um, but I'm trying to get a better handle on it.

Supporter: I understand how you feel, it can be very challenging jumping into something new. What might help is to try to prioritize what is most important first and focus on that.

It likely isn't going to happen overnight, as much as you are probably wanting to find it quickly, some things require patience. Some of the best things in life are worth waiting for. Your house is out there, you just have to have faith that with time and patience it will come to you.

Try and focus on how you will be feeling once you do find that perfect home you are searching for.

The pros for me moving into the the other house is that it would allow me to take care of another person that needs taken care of and it would lower my current expenses to live there. The problem is that I have a disability that affects my mobility. And if I move to this other house, I will have to go up some very steep stairs to get to my room and that will be very difficult for me. I also need to do major renovations on several rooms in that house before it'll be liable for me. And that will cost me thousands and thousands of dollars. And I'm living on a limited budget right now. If I go ahead and do this and use all that money to make the repairs to the other house, I could be very happy living there. But if something happens to the person who actually owns the house, I could be forced to leave and then lose everything. There's a possibility though that if anything happens to the owner of that house, I may be able to take over the mortgage, but the amount that the mortgage costs is extremely expensive, I could probably afford it, but I'm not positive. So I'm not sure if it would be better for me to stay where I am and try and make repairs to this house, even though I could also possibly lose this house if anything happens to the other person or if I should go ahead and make repairs to the other house and possibly lose everything.

Both options, whether to stay in your current situation or to move have some road bumps, but nothing too extravagant. Yes, both you may have to put money up front, but the outcome of either sound like they would be financially worthy in the end. However if you are asking my opinion, I would say the second option of moving would benefit both you and the person you could potentially help out.

I've been working at the same job for about five plus years now and while it does pay good and I'm good at doing the job, I've been, uh, pretty jaded over the past few months about, uh, really my lack of advancement at the company, uh, which is probably going to exist for, uh, quite a while now. Um, I really just want to explore, uh, something new, a different career path and it's something that's, uh, pretty difficult and pretty scary to quit. One job that gives me a, a stable, uh, say stable wage and transitioning to another job. It may take a while to even, uh, get another job in the current job market. Um, so that's definitely a situation that's, uh, pretty complex. A lot of moving parts and something that I've been, uh, grappling with for some time now.

Supporter: That is a tough situation.  That must be a hard thing to wrestle with all the time. I think there are definitely ways to make your dream come true, but in a safe way.  You could create a plan for yourself with action steps to help get it out of your head and on paper.  Then you could look at each step that you would need to take and see how feasible it would be.  Talking to a trusted friend or someone that is already working in the field would help as well.

62cbf51439a76e8fccd8a495,"Seeker: My sister died, um, really too soon. And it's was traumatic on everybody and especially her sons and the one son, as much as we try to help him just kind of went crazy and gotten a lot of trouble legally. And he ended up getting arrested and he finally ended up pleading guilty and he's got mental health issues. So they're letting him live at home under like house arrest for his entire sentence. And then he has a more intensive, uh, time seeing like a parole type officer and he's getting a lot of mental health treatment and so forth. But he had to move in with his father who was my sister's ex-husband who does not get along with any of the family. So now my nephew is there, he's not responding to phone calls. I believe his father is in charge of his phone and has the numbers all blocked and we have no way to communicate. We know if we send letters and so forth, they don't reach him and being his sentence is for, um, almost three years, we don't know what to do. My mother's getting older and I'm concerned that she's not ever gonna get to see her grandson again or talk to him and he's, um, just not mentally healthy right now and my mom's older and she just cries and cries.

Supporter: That's a really tough situation. It's hard not to be able so see someone that you love, and not know whether they're safe or not. Hopefully in the near future you will be able to contact your nephew and get in touch with him.

63d1834e69a637cd32f16634,"Seeker: Right now, I'm really struggling to try to figure out how to find the time to go back to school. I'm juggling a couple part time jobs and I'm not really making it financially. I do have a family too and I'm going to be taking programming classes. It's kind of like a coding boot camp and I'm hoping that that will help me build some skills to land a better job. But I'm very nervous about being able to pull it off. So I feel like just working, you know, a couple of part time jobs that are pretty flexible. I'm already having a really difficult time, you know, just taking care of stuff, taking care of my family and doing what I have to do right now. I'm really worried about being able to find the time to actually pull off this, you know, this training school program that I want. You know, I feel like I might fail because I'm not gonna be able to devote enough time to it. And it's very nerve wracking because it's super important that I accomplish this

Supporter: It makes sense that you're feeling overwhelmed by all of this. You are juggling a lot at the moment and that is not easy to do. It sounds as though you have a great plan in place to take some programming classes to help your financial situation long term. It can be scary to take that first step into the unknown but so often it pays off. Good luck with it all.

609122350e5b8e743ab41f79,"Seeker: My dad is getting older and he lives many states away and I can't afford to go visit him. But I'm afraid that he's gonna pass before I get a chance to go and see him again. So I'm wondering if there's some way I can try to save up money to go and visit or whatever. But at the same time, things are really hard right now financially, um, where we live is pretty high cost of living and, you know, we've had some hard times because of the pandemic. So, you know, I know it's like money is and everything and, um, you can't take it with you when you go and I know that if he passes, I'll regret it for not going to visit him. But I just don't know how I can manage it.

Supporter: That is unfortunate and I can definitely understand the situation. It's sad when distance separates people because as you said it can be very difficult logistically or financially to go see them. My best advice would be to make sure that you still do spend plenty of time with them remotely on phone calls and the like and try to save money in a special fund to go see him.
